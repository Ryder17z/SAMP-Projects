On line 40 the debug level can be set:
```
new DEBUG_PICKUP_LEVEL = 4; // set the debug level
```
These debug levels are available:
```
	DEBUG_PICKUP_NONE = -1,		// (-1) No prints
	DEBUG_PICKUP_INFO,			  // (0) Print information messages
	DEBUG_PICKUP_FOLDERS,	  	// (1) Print each directory
	DEBUG_PICKUP_FILES,		  	// (2) Print each file loaded
	DEBUG_PICKUP_LINES,		  	// (3) Print each line loaded
	DEBUG_PICKUP_BUFFER		  	// (4) Print line buffering
```

This script is released as I have no personal interest in updating this for my own use

TODO: Create a ingame saving function for this script
And maybe at a later stage also have a remove function and a edit options function ingame too
